= Some notes about all the exchanges:

- we will talk first about what we are trying to implement/change in each exchange file
- we will then make those changes but keep in mind that:
    - FIRST WE WILL DO THE GREEDY ALGORITHM
    - then we will do the changes
- all changes are listed in order
    - first exchange 1
    - then 2
    - then etc etc
