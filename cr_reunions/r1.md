# project quality of research

## Introduction
Selecting of papers/publications of people belonging to department.
According to constraints

## Constraints VQR4:
1. each person must propose at least 1 paper as an author
2. each person can propose at most 4 papers
3. Each paper can be presented at most once
4. If 1st rule can't be done, no substituion of paper are allowed
5. else, substitution are allowed if the person is at least co-author of the paper 
6. select number of papers defined by number of person in department multiplied by 2.5, rounded to the lowest integer
	ex:
		people in department = 10 
		number of papers = 10 * 2.5 = 25  


## requirement
- some examples are already made
- some of them are tested
- not all
- we have to develop an algorithm to solve that

## steps for the algorithm
- verify each people can give a paper
    - selects the bests papers to reach 10 (1 for each person)
- select the rest (to go to 25)
    - make it greedy (from better to least and check who can take it)
- select who will present what

## steps for the project
1. FORMALISATION THE PROBLEM
    - prepare slides can be an idea
    - uses of materials
    - also find how to make a value between papers
        - bibliometrics informations are actually used
2. USE DATAS TO MAKE THE ALGORITHM AND TEST IT
    - 80-85 people
    - 1-4 papers
    - to reach 80-85 * 2.5
    - files are like:
	    - src/importExcel.py: utility to correctly import the 2 excel file with only the relevant columns
	    - config.json: columns to be used 
	    - provaImport.py: invoke importExcel.py as a test
        - "DipinfoAfferenze": list of professors
        - Other XLSX files are list of papers (with extraction date)

## notes for amelioration
(seen later)
- you want to present a paper but you cant because you're already at 4 papers presented
- you can take one of your paper and give it to a co-author 
    - co-author has to have a slot to fill
    - if they don't, it can be recursive (he can give one of his paper to a co-author to make space for the new one)
