= project quality of research

== Introduction
Selecting of papers/publications of people belonging to department.
According to constraints

== main constraint:
1. 1 pub can be presented once by only one people

== other constraints
2. select number of papers definined by nb of person (2.5) in department mult by number (?)
3. 2 papers per persons
4. no substitution allowed (paper written by someone else not allowed)
5. 4 papers can be PROVIDED by anyone in the departement
6. if not enough papers can be done by one person, then paper can be given by co-autor typed
7. the min number of paper per person is 1
8. if no papers as author, then no subsitution is possible and DON'T affect the others count as a paper

== example

10 people -> 25 papers
and 10 have to be from each one

== requirement
- some examples are already made
- some of them are tested
- not all
- we have to develop an algorithm to solve that

== steps for the algorithm
- verify each people can give a paper
    - selects the bests papers to reach 10
- select the rest (to go to 25)
    - make it greedy (from better to least and check who can take it)
- select who will present what

== steps for the project
1. FORMALISATION THE PROBLEM
    - prepare slides can be an idea
    - uses of materials
    - also find how to make a value beetwen papers
        - bibliometrics imformations are actually used
2. USE DATAS TO MAKE THE ALGORITHM AND TEST IT
    - 80-85 people
    - 1-4 papers
    - to reach 80-85 * 2.5
    - files are like:
        - "DipinfoAfferenze" list of professors
        - Other XLSX files are list of papers (with extraction date)

== notes for amelioration
(seen later)
- we can change the papers to be "presented" by a coauthor if you want to present one you can't because of free place
    - coauthor have to have a slot to fill
    - can be recursive (can give to give to give)
