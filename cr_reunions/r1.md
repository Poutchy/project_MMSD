= project quality of research

== Introduction
Selecting of papers/publications of people belonging to department.
According to constraints

== Constraints VQR4:
1. 1 pub can be presented once by only one people
2. select number of papers defined by number of person in department multiplied by 2.5, rounded to the lowest integer
	ex:
		people in department = 10 
		number of papers = 10 * 2.5 = 25  

4. no substitution allowed (paper written by someone else not allowed)
5. each paper can be used at most 1 time
6. no one can present a paper he didn't took part in either as a author or co-author
7. each person can provide max 4 papers 
8. each person must provide at least 1 paper
9. if someone has less than 4 papers, then paper can be given as co-author
10. if no papers as author, then no substitution is possible and DON'T affect the others count as a paper

== requirement
- some examples are already made
- some of them are tested
- not all
- we have to develop an algorithm to solve that

== steps for the algorithm
- verify each people can give a paper
    - selects the bests papers to reach 10 (1 for each person)
- select the rest (to go to 25)
    - make it greedy (from better to least and check who can take it)
- select who will present what

== steps for the project
1. FORMALISATION THE PROBLEM
    - prepare slides can be an idea
    - uses of materials
    - also find how to make a value between papers
        - bibliometrics informations are actually used
2. USE DATAS TO MAKE THE ALGORITHM AND TEST IT
    - 80-85 people
    - 1-4 papers
    - to reach 80-85 * 2.5
    - files are like:
	    - src/importExcel.py: utility to correctly import the 2 excel file with only the relevant columns
	    - config.json: columns to be used 
	    - provaImport.py: invoke importExcel.py as a test
        - "DipinfoAfferenze": list of professors
        - Other XLSX files are list of papers (with extraction date)

== notes for amelioration
(seen later)
- you want to present a paper but you cant because you're already at 4 papers presented
- you can take one of your paper and give it to a co-author 
    - co-author has to have a slot to fill
    - if they don't, it can be recursive (he can give one of his paper to a co-author to make space for the new one)
