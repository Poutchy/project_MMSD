# project_MMSD

## What is the project?
The project is a optimisation algorithm used for departments VQR.
This code is entirely made in python.

## What do we have implemented?

### Types
We use multiple types, however 2 of them are the foundation of that project:

- Person type
- Paper type

A Person is someone that is part of a department and can publish any number of Paper.
A Paper is a scientific publication made by a department and written by a Person.

### Functions
This project is mostly used for the main function in the ```algorithm.py``` file. It is entirely documented, you should check it out.

### Algorithms
We implemented multiple algorithms for that project, and all of their pseudo code can be found in the ```pseudo/``` directory, you should check it out.
